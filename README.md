# Firefighter Education Guide
This project is a single-page, responsive web guide designed to inform Texas firefighters about the state's tuition and fee exemption program as authorized by Texas Education Code ยง54.353.

The guide provides a comprehensive overview of the educational benefits available to both paid and volunteer firefighters, including:

Eligibility Requirements: Clear breakdowns of the criteria for paid and volunteer personnel.

Interactive Data Visualizations: Charts displaying the distribution of participating institutions (universities vs. community colleges) and the types of degrees/certifications available.

Comprehensive Lists: Curated and hyperlinked lists of all participating Texas public universities and community colleges with qualifying fire science and public administration programs.

Action Plan: A simple, 4-step flowchart to guide firefighters through the process of enrolling and claiming their exemption.

This resource was created to be easily shared as a standalone webpage or converted to a PDF, empowering Texas firefighters to advance their careers through free, state-funded education.
